from the analysis performed, we observed that the best payment method used by our customer is credit card even though we had some high result for bank transfer also, I recommend the stakeholder should look into the reasons why our customer prefer using credit card than others, and also put the instruction on how to use bank transfer on the company website and also paste it in the company premises for easy use since most of our customer are retail.

The best sales person is David with the highest generating revenue. I recommend the stakeholders should enquire from David the best sales representative the market strategy or methods he put in place to generate more sales and inform the other sales representative to apply them.

The sales channel used most by the company customer is retail sales channel,this means the customer prefers purchasing the products through retail sales channel than online channel, i recommend the stakeholders should look into how to improve online user experience by simplifying the browsing experience to make it easier for customers to find what they are looking for.they should also ensure the website is mobile- friendly as many customers may shop on their phones or tablets

Improve website load times and reduce any technical problems that could discourage the company customers from completing their purchase online and also ensure to make the navigation to the website more easier.

Give discount on shipping fee on online purchase order to make the accessibility of shopping or buying online more attractive compared to in-store visits.

Suggest a fast or same-day delivery options to meet the demands of online shoppers who value speed and convenience

The best region with the highest revenue is the Northern region. I recommend that the stakeholders should analyze the strategies or plans that have worked well in the Northern region, then apply them to other regions with similar customer profiles or market conditions.

Share best practices, sales plans, and successful marketing strategies with other regions, influence what’s working well in the northern region to elevate overall company performance.

Ensure the Northern region has more inventory to meet demand, specifically for products that are performing well or generating high revenue for the company to avoid losing customer

Since the sales performance for the Northern region is high, the stakeholder can also consider opening additional stores or increasing the number of sites or branches to capitalize on more achievement or success.

The stakeholder should enhance more distribution channels and logistics to ensure faster, more effective delivery to the Northern region

The highest generating product category is clothing. I recommend that the stakeholders should ensure there is enough stock to meet growing demand. Since the product generates more revenue for the company.

Since the high product category is clothing , the stakeholder can also consider introducing variations like different colors of cloth, different sizes, or styles to target larger audience and more new customers

For analysis of the customer type , the percentage in revenue generated is the same. I recommend that the stakeholder should look into rewarding the recurrent customers who purchase the high-performing product repeatedly with discounts, slash sales offers, special offers and many exciting rewards to always encourage them to patronize more and also attract new customers.
